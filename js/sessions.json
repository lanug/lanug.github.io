        "Description": "Be it a T-SQL Developer or DBA, we spend most of our time working in SSMS. In this session, we will learn a number of tips and tricks to increase productivity and efficiency in SSMS IDE. This will be a content rich session with plenty of live demos.\n \nEvery developer wants to be productive and get more things accomplished during their day to day work. Given a choice between working harder and working smarter, you will most likely choose the latter. But the big question is – How do you boost your productivity? How do you reduce your development time? How do you increase your coding speed? Gaining a superlative understanding of the IDE goes a long way in increasing one’s productivity.\n \nSQL Server Management Studio has a number of hidden features which might not have been advertised much, but knowing these features will make your life so much easier.We will explore ways to stop doing manual repetitive tasks, use shortcuts, type less and generate more lines of code in minimal time. At the end of this session, you will learn some useful techniques to take back with you and apply in your day to day work.",

At the core of this talk is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which is part of SOLID Programming Principles. The speaker will demonstrate how to refactor legacy code and apply SRP. SOLID Programming is a set of five essential principles which can lead to robust, long - lasting code.Robert C.Martin,software engineer and celebrated author of some of the most essential programming books today, coined the acronym SOLID to represent a collection of what he considered the most essential principles for any programmer.The first component of SOLID is the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP),and in the world of enterprise software engineering,not applying SRP can quickly lead to code with the power of the gods and the inflexibility of a fluorescent light bulb.However, by learning and applying SRP, armed with the power of interfaces and the safety net of unit testing,a programmer can transform almost any code base from untouchable 'legacy code' into living, adaptive code that creates value and can stand the test of time.",
